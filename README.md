## Our Goal
Our goal is to provide insights and projections about the progression of coronavirus pandemic in a fast, clean and understandable way. We have developed a publicly available tool that helps everyone to comprehend the huge amount of information and numbers. This is necessary because peopleâ€™s behavior is the main lever for controlling the outcome of the disease.


Here are the results of COVID-Analysis.com project.
